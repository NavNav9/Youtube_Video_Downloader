This is my first ever app that I actually made myself and posted on github. It's a very basic app that has a UI and downloads Youtube Videos and plays it back

The core concept is completed however there are things to be added;

- Better UI
- Better Video Quality
- Bug fixes such as the video not being chosen correctly
